# Mathematica_Phys_Calculations
Some simple mathematica notebooks used for two generic purposes: calculating useful quantities or experimental rates in the context of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices (bose-hubbard physics), or useful demonstration code for physical effects

## Bose-Hubbard Experimental Notebooks

single_photon_scatter_notebook.nb -- comparison of scattering rates in optical lattices. Involves both a numerical calculation compared to a theory prediction given the assumption of deep traps. This is then compared to experiments in the Li & Rb Experiments for the Greiner Lab at Harvard as there are some published measurements to be compared to.






## Simple Demonstration Example Code

DrudeModelIQH.nb -- provides the classical intuition for the classical hall effect that can be transferred to integer quantum hall effect
