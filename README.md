# Mathematica_Phys_Calculations
Some simple mathematica notebooks used for two generic purposes: calculating useful quantities or experimental rates in the context of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices (bose-hubbard physics), or useful demonstration code for physical effects

## Bose-Hubbard Experimental Notebooks

### single_photon_scatter_notebook.nb
Comparison of scattering rates in optical lattices. Involves both a numerical calculation compared to a theory prediction given the assumption of deep traps. This is then compared to experiments in the Li & Rb Experiments for the Greiner Lab at Harvard as there are some published measurements to be compared to.

### bose_hubbard_volume_scaling_laws.nb
Description of scaling laws for particle number fluctuations and particle number entropy in finite, fixed particle number bose-hubbard systems at infinite temperature. This also distinguishes between scaling of of system size and sub-system size and what type of general formulation one should expect. In general this notebook should give some insight on how to make some generalizations about the thermal expectation of a bose-hubbard system and derive some simple scaling laws from it.


## Simple Demonstration Example Code

### DrudeModelIQH.nb
This provides the classical intuition for the classical hall effect that can be transferred to integer quantum hall effect .
